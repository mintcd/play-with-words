But a soldier may forsake his family to serve his country, knowing that it is his duty even though it may cause emotional pain.\n\nAbandon describes a negative action that shows carelessness, neglect, or disregard towards something or someone, while forsake is often used to describe a positive action where a person chooses to leave behind something for a higher calling or a greater good.","wordImage":"https://word-images.cdn-wordup.com/senses/5a8f56ac-53f9-419e-bd70-e328484cf18c.webp?v=1"},"Give up":{"wordRoot":"Give up","wordDefinition":"Give up means to cease trying, to relinquish or surrender. It implies a sense of defeat or resignation.\n\nGive up might be applicable when talking about a person who has given up on achieving a particular goal or a team that has given up on winning a game.\n\nAbandon implies a physical sense of leaving something behind, while give up implies a more emotional sense of surrender or defeat.","wordImage":"https://word-images.cdn-wordup.com/senses/fb0ae6c0-9951-453c-85d7-6c0c9624c2d5.webp?v=1"},"Leave":{"wordRoot":"Leave","wordDefinition":"Leave means to depart from a place or situation.","wordImage":"https://word-images.cdn-wordup.com/senses/7512cdc6-ccba-4ee8-8c07-a14221c28da5.webp?v=1"},"Neglect":{"wordRoot":"Neglect","wordDefinition":"Neglect means to fail to take care of something or someone, either intentionally or unintentionally. For example, neglecting to water a plant means not taking care of the plant, which could lead to its death.\n\nAbandon means leaving something or someone with no responsibility, while neglect means not taking good care of something or someone.","wordImage":"https://word-images.cdn-wordup.com/senses/01767325-0750-45ac-884b-339c782f6033.webp?v=1"},"Relinquish":{"wordRoot":"Relinquish","wordDefinition":"Relinquish means to let go or release something, such as a possession, control or responsibility, willingly or under certain conditions.\n\nIt is more of a positive term and implies a sense of surrender or altruism. For instance, a person might relinquish their position or authority, a property or a right.\n\nAbandon is used when there is a sense of betrayal, rejection or disregard, while relinquish is used when there is a sense of sacrifice, generosity or compliance.","wordImage":"https://word-images.cdn-wordup.com/senses/733da940-4090-478d-9575-aa9dcd7bae82.webp?v=1"},"Surrender":{"wordRoot":"Surrender","wordDefinition":"Surrender means to give up control or to give in to someone or something.\n\nFor example: A person may surrender in a fight or may surrender their weapons to the police.\n\nAbandon is used when you totally give up something, and surrender means giving up control of something or someone to someone else.","wordImage":"https://word-images.cdn-wordup.com/senses/a0619e96-d509-4b9d-bf56-12d4f832b98d.webp?v=1"}},"videos":[{"Text":" But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
